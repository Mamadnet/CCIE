ACL


(config)#access-list ?
  <1-99>            IP standard access list
  <100-199>         IP extended access list
  <1300-1999>       IP standard access list (expanded range)
  <2000-2699>       IP extended access list (expanded range)
  acl-ace-limit     set the max configurable ace limit for all ACLs
  acl-limit         Set the max configurable acl limit
  dynamic-extended  Extend the dynamic ACL absolute timer
  global-ace-limit  set the max ace limit for the entire system
  rate-limit        Simple rate-limit specific access list



(config)#ip access-list ?
  extended    Extended Access List
  helper      Access List acts on helper-address
  log-update  Control access list log updates
  logging     Control access list logging
  persistent  enable persistency across reload
  resequence  Resequence Access List
  role-based  Role-based Access List
  standard    Standard Access List


Can be of two types
• Standard
• Extended
Configuration wise, both standard and extended can
be
• Numbered (legacy, identified by a number)
• Named (identified by a meaningful name)

Standard ACL
    Inbound ACL is for data and Control traffic
    standard ACL is not for layer 4
    it only usematches source ip header
    ehen it is used on vty outbound - it matches destination ip header
Considerations
    • An empty ACL uses an implicit ‘permit any’
    • Not recommended to be applied inbound
    • When applied inbound, ensure to allow IPv4 control-plane/
    management-plane traffic



Extended ACL

    • Can match the protocol number from the layer 3 header
    (OSPF, EIGRP, ESP, AH)
    • Can match on both source and destination IP from the
    layer 3 header
    • Can match on the layer 4 protocol and its ports (TCP, UDP)

    • Can match on the TCP flags, IPv4/IPv6 options
    • Can match on IPv4/IPv6 fragments
    • Can match on IPv4/IPv6 packet marking (Precedence,
    DSCP)

Considerations

    • An empty ACL uses an implicit ‘permit any any’
    • When applied inbound, ensure to allow IPv4/IPv6 controlplane
    traffic


IPv6 used ICMPv6 packets for two main reasons
    • Neighbor discovery (what was ARP in IPv4)
    • Router discovery (IPv6 host auto-addressing via SLAAC)
ICMPv6 ND packets
    • Neighbor discovery uses the NS and NA messages
    • Router Discovery use the RS and RA messages
Cisco claims that, when inbound IPv6 ACL is applied
    • ICMPv6 (NS,NA,RS,RA) messages are implicitly allowed,
    but don’t rely on it






#Reflexive Access Lists


ou can approximate session filtering by using the established keyword with the permit command. The established keyword filters TCP packets based on whether the ACK or RST bits are set. (Set ACK or RST bits indicate that the packet is not the first in the session, 
and therefore, that the packet belongs to an established session.)
